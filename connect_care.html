                <strong>Description</strong><br><br>
                Connect Care is a mobile application designed to provide accessible basic medical care for refugees living in Korea. Refugees often endure long, exhausting journeys with minimal access to essential services and face systemic barriers to healthcare due to xenophobia and discrimination. In addition, many refugees are at significant risk of poor mental health due to the traumatic experiences associated with displacement and seeking refuge. Connect Care offers a safe, supportive platform where refugees can access healthcare resources, receive reminders for medical checkups, and track their well-being. By fostering a welcoming environment, the app emphasizes that refugees have the right to health services and compassionate care, just like any other individual.

                <strong>Motivation</strong><br><br>
                The creation of Connect Care was driven by the urgent need to address healthcare disparities faced by refugees in Korea. Observing the exclusion of refugees from medical programs and recognizing the severe physical and mental health challenges they endure motivated me to develop a solution that bridges these gaps. Connect Care was designed to advocate for equal treatment and ensure that refugees can access vital health services without fear of discrimination. By empowering them to take control of their health, this platform seeks to restore dignity and hope to displaced individuals.

                <strong>Research</strong><br><br>
                Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet many refugees are denied this right due to systemic barriers and social prejudice. Refugees often arrive in host countries in poor health, suffering from malnutrition, untreated chronic conditions, or injuries sustained during their journeys. Mental health is another critical concern, as many have experienced trauma, violence, and loss.<br><br>
                According to the UNHCR, only a small percentage of refugees worldwide have consistent access to mental health support, exacerbating feelings of isolation and distress. Women and children, in particular, face heightened vulnerability to health complications and lack sufficient prenatal, postnatal, and pediatric care (source: https://apnews.com/article/congo-conflict-mental-health-88642207a472870de36e5f434ead5990). Research for Connect Care focused on addressing these disparities by providing features that meet practical healthcare needs, such as appointment reminders, health center locations, and mental health resources.<br><br>
                The main problems Connect Care aims to solve are:<br><br>
                <strong>1. Lack of Access to Healthcare Services</strong><br>
                Refugees often face barriers to healthcare due to language differences, xenophobia, and systemic discrimination, which prevent them from receiving timely medical attention.<br><br>
                <strong>2. Mental Health Challenges</strong><br>
                Traumatic experiences associated with displacement lead to poor mental health among refugees, but access to mental health resources is limited.<br><br>
                <strong>3. Lack of Information and Resources</strong><br>
                Refugees are often unaware of nearby health centers, available services, or how to navigate healthcare systems in a new country.<br><br>
                <strong>4. Inconsistent Medical Management</strong><br>
                Refugees may miss important health checkups and medication schedules without structured reminders or tools to track their health.

                <strong>Solution</strong><br><br>
                <strong>1. User-Friendly Navigation with Intuitive Design</strong><br>
                The interface uses simple shapes, primary colors, and clear layouts to create an accessible experience, making it easier for users of all literacy levels and languages to navigate.<br><br>
                <strong>2. Personalized Medical Reminders and Daily Checklists</strong><br>
                A reminder system helps refugees stay on top of their health appointments and medication schedules, ensuring more consistent medical management.<br><br>
                <strong>3. Health Center Locator Feature</strong><br>
                By providing a map and listing local healthcare facilities, Connect Care makes it easier for refugees to find nearby clinics and services.<br><br>
                <strong>4. Mental Health Resource Access</strong><br>
                The app includes mental health support features, such as guides, contact information for mental health professionals, and a welcoming design that encourages users to seek help.<br><br>
                <strong>5. Secure and Private User Experience</strong><br>
                Data privacy features ensure that sensitive user information is protected, fostering trust and safety in using the app.<br><br>
                By addressing these problems through thoughtful design and functionality, Connect Care empowers refugees to better manage their health and receive the care they need with dignity and ease.

                <strong>Final Design</strong><br><br>
                The logo for Connect Care—a heart with a pattern of fenced heartbeats inside—symbolizes health, love, and care for refugees. The app's design focuses on creating an engaging, user-friendly interface through the use of bold shapes and primary colors, making navigation intuitive and visually appealing.
