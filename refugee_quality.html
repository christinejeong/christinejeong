                <strong>Description</strong><br><br>
                Refugee Quality is a website that helps refugees adjust to new environments and feel belonged by offering various online courses, job opportunities, spaces for communication, and donations. The platform offers different online courses to help young refugees deepen their knowledge and dream big for their future. I sincerely believe in the importance of free and quality education for all, especially for refugees, whose learning experience is disrupted by the wake of war and political violence. To logically visualize the brand website that is easily navigatable for children, I drew colorful illustrations that are placed next to corresponding texts to visually explain the context of the website at first glance. In this project, typography also plays a key role as legibility and accessibility were two main factors carefully considered in the production of this website.

                <strong>Motivation</strong><br><br>
                During junior year of high school, after reaching out to the Refugee Administration Ministry (RAM) in Korea, I got an exciting chance to tutor three Syrian refugee children English. Seeing their shy and passive attitude during class, I was determined to make them realize that they deserve to be cared for, just like anyone else. This led me to design Refugee Quality, a website that helps refugees in Korea obtain the basic rights lost by war and discrimination and feel like they belong.

                <strong>Research</strong><br><br>
                <strong>Part 1: Education</strong><br>
                A refugee is a person who has fled their own country because they are at risk of serious human rights violations and persecution there. They are forced to flee due to war, conflict, violence, hunger, poverty, discrimination based on sexual/gender orientation, and natural disasters or climate change. These journeys, though motivated by hope for a better future, are often fraught with danger and fear. Upon arriving in a new country, refugees face systemic barriers: they are detained by authorities, subjected to daily racism and xenophobia, and often feel isolated, having lost their communities, families, and support networks.<br><br>
                One of the most significant challenges for refugees is the lack of access to education, which is a critical pathway to rebuilding their lives. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), only 68% of refugee children attend primary school, compared to a global average of 91%. As the educational ladder progresses, the gap widens further—only 37% of refugee youth are enrolled in secondary education, and a mere 6% have access to higher education. Girls and women face even greater educational inequality, as cultural barriers, gender-based violence, and limited resources disproportionately hinder their opportunities for learning. In many refugee communities, girls are two and a half times more likely to be out of school than boys (source: https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-refugees-sudan-immigration-detention-center-b0bc00d0def8c3544c9251eef5a45a4f). Without access to education, refugees are trapped in cycles of poverty and marginalization, deprived of the tools they need to create a better future.<br><br>
                I believe in the importance of education, especially for refugee populations, where the learning that others take for granted is often disrupted by crisis. Equal education is significant not only because people can navigate the necessary skills for jobs and social life, but also because it is the most natural and basic right as humans. Education is a powerful tool in lifting socially excluded children and adults out of poverty and into society. For this human right to work, there must be equality of opportunity, universal access, and enforceable and monitored quality standards.<br><br>
                <strong>Part 2: Additional Needs</strong><br>
                In developing Refugee Equality, the project evolved from focusing solely on education to incorporating more practical tools that address refugees' day-to-day needs. Through continuous research and interviews with Middle Eastern refugees living in South Korea, I identified three key necessities that significantly impact their quality of life:<br><br>
                <strong>1. Finding a job</strong><br>
                Employment is essential for refugees to regain financial stability and independence. However, many face difficulties in navigating the local job market due to language barriers, a lack of recognized qualifications, or limited job networks.<br><br>
                <strong>2. Obtaining basic supplies and needs</strong><br>
                Access to basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter is a constant challenge for many refugees.<br><br>
                <strong>3. A community</strong><br>
                Refugees often experience profound isolation after being uprooted from their home countries and separated from family and friends. A supportive community is vital for emotional well-being and social integration.

                <strong>Solution</strong><br><br>
                <strong>Part 1: Education</strong><br>
                Refugee Equality addresses this gap by providing free online courses to foster learning, empowerment, and opportunities for young refugees to dream beyond their current circumstances.<br><br>
                After making their own account, students can find the “courses and materials” button where they can choose their own courses based on their interests. Students could explore and read additional information about any course by clicking on each icon. After reading the descriptions, students could apply for the subjects that they want to take.<br><br>
                Through colorful and simple illustrations, texts, and content like ‘my status’ and ‘news’ pages, the platform creates an enjoyable learning experience for refugee children. The simplicity and illustrations make the website easy and convenient enough for children to approach and explore.<br><br>
                <strong>Part 2: Additional Needs</strong><br><br>
                <strong>1. Job opportunities</strong><br>
                Refugee Equality provides job listings tailored to refugees and connects them with employers willing to offer training and opportunities.<br><br>
                <strong>2. Donation</strong><br>
                Refugee Equality includes a donation platform where users can contribute essential items or funds directly to refugee families and communities in need. This fosters a spirit of collective support and allows refugees to receive the assistance required for survival and stability.<br><br>
                <strong>3. Social space</strong><br>
                Refugee Equality offers a dedicated social space where refugees can communicate, share experiences, and build meaningful connections. By facilitating peer-to-peer interaction and providing access to local support groups, the platform helps refugees feel a sense of belonging and inclusion in their new environments.
